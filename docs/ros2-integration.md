# ROS2 DSIL Integration

ROS2 integration layer for the Atlas deterministic sensor infrastructure platform.

This repository provides ROS2 nodes that decode DSIL telemetry streams generated
by the Atlas Fusion hardware platform and publish synchronized sensor data
to ROS2 topics.

# Atlas Platform Architecture

Sensors → Atlas Fusion Hardware → DSIL SDK → ROS2 → Robot Applications

Atlas Fusion generates deterministic telemetry streams which are decoded by
the DSIL SDK and published to ROS2 for robotics applications.
